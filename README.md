# NftMetadataIndexerKitNext

## Description

This repository implements a novel NFT marketplace protocol leveraging Merkle tree-based ownership verification on-chain and off-chain data storage via IPFS for metadata, enabling gas-efficient batch transfers and decentralized content persistence.

## Features

- Indexes NFT metadata from multiple blockchains using a configurable adapter pattern.
- Implements a GraphQL API for querying NFT metadata with advanced filtering and sorting capabilities.
- Utilizes a distributed caching layer (e.g., Redis) to improve metadata retrieval performance.
- Supports real-time indexing of NFT mints, transfers, and burns via blockchain event listeners.
- Provides a customizable data transformation pipeline for normalizing metadata across different standards (e.g., ERC-721, ERC-1155).
- Integrates with decentralized storage solutions (e.g., IPFS, Arweave) to resolve and cache off-chain metadata.
- Offers a modular plugin architecture for extending functionality with custom metadata parsers and enrichers.
- Deploys a robust monitoring system with alerting capabilities for detecting indexing failures and data inconsistencies.
